## Hey!

I'm a Web UI developer at Witco.io, I've been developing on web technologies since 2018, driven by a sense of elevating and perfectioning user interfaces üé®.

I created my own website ‚û°Ô∏è https://thefrankemon.dev, by using the tech I'm more skilled at: [Angular](https://angular.io), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) and [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
