## Hey!

I'm a Frontend Web developer, I've been developing on web technologies since 2018, driven by a sense of elevating and perfectioning user interfaces üé®.

My area of expertise resides on the use of TypeScript and CSS over multiple flavors:
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

I created my own website ‚û°Ô∏è https://thefrankemon.dev using [Angular](https://angular.io), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) and [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
